This project uses Spark(Scala) for building a comprehensive sales data pipeline for a retail company. The pipeline generated 
combines sales data with data from external sources (api end points). Data transformations and aggregations are performed, and store the final dataset in a database. The aim this project is to enable analysis and derive insights into customer behaviour and sales performance.
